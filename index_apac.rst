Nutanix Global Tech Summit
--------------------------

Welcome to Nutanix Global Tech Summit 2019!

Following the General Session on Tuesday morning, you will be able to access the **Hands on Learning** lab content.

Labs are designed to be completed by each individual, not in groups. Each Nutanix employee **Hands on Learning** participant must complete the listed **Required Labs** as well as a minimum of 1 **Sponsored Lab**. You should be able to complete 2-4 additional **Optional Labs** by the end of the day Wednesday.

For each lab you complete & validate, you'll be entered into a raffle to win a `complete Raspberry Pi 3 kit <https://www.aboxtek.com/products/abox-raspberry-pi-3b-16gb>`_! See :ref:`validation` below for additional details.

**Stuck? Have questions?** See :ref:`validation` for instruction on getting help.

Cluster Assignments

.. _clusteraccess:

Cluster Access
++++++++++++++

Clusters used for both the **Hands on Learning** and **Field Focussed Hackathon** tracks run within the Hosted POC environment, hosted in the Nutanix PHX1 datacenter.

In order to access these resources you must be connected to one of the (2) VPN options listed below. Connection to a virtual desktop environment **is not necessary**.

.. note::

  Certain labs leverage a Windows VM with pre-installed tools to provide a controlled environment. It is **highly recommended** that you connect to these Windows VMs using the Microsoft Remote Desktop client rather than the VM console launched via Prism. An RDP connection will allow you to copy and paste between your device and the VMs.

Nutanix Employees
.................

Log in to https://gp.nutanix.com using your OKTA credentials.

Download and install the appropriate GlobalProtect agent for your operating system.

Launch GlobalProtect and configure **gp.nutanix.com** as the **Portal** address.

Connect using your Okta credentials.

.. note::

  Connect to a Split Tunnel (ST) gateway to ensure only network traffic targeting the Hosted POC environment is sent over the VPN.

Partners
........

Refer to :ref:`clusterassignments` for your Lab VPN username and password.

Log in to https://lab-vpn.nutanix.com using the provided credentials.

Under **Client Application Sessions**, click **Start** to the right of **Pulse Secure** to download the client.

Install and open **Pulse Secure**.

Add a connection:

- **Type** - Policy Secure (UAC) or Connection Server
- **Name** - HPOC VPN
- **Server URL** - lab-vpn.nutanix.com

Connect using the provided credentials.
