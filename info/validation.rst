Validating Completed Labs
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

For each lab you complete, you will be entered into a raffle to win a `complete Raspberry Pi 3 kit <https://www.aboxtek.com/products/abox-raspberry-pi-3b-16gb>`_. Raffle winners will be announced during the closing General Session on Thursday.

Completing *Optional* sections of a lab is not required for validation.

- Open the lab that you wish to have validated.

- Click either the **Get Help** link in the toolbar or the :fa:`question-circle` icon in the sidebar to open a request.
