Peer Global File Service
------------------------

*The estimated time to complete this lab is 45 minutes.*

Overview
++++++++

Peer Global File Service (PeerGFS) in an enterprise solution that solves file service challenges in multi-site and multi-vendor environments, integrating with both on-prem and cloud storage platforms. PeerGFS creates a single unified globally accessible file system to provide all users with fast local access to their data, while simultaneously enabling Real-time Backup and High Availability.

PeerGFS is powered by DFSR+Â®, Peer's patented and proprietary enterprise-class replication and file locking technology. Integration with most major storage platforms, *including support for Nutanix Files*, enables real-time file replication between different storage systems so that administrators can freely copy and move data wherever it needs to be. Integrated distributed file locking prevents version conflicts in collaborative environments where the same file exists in multiple locations to allow users fast local access to project files.

*How does it work?*

.. figure:: images/integration.png

Working from left to right, users interact with the SMB shares on the Nutanix Files cluster via a public LAN. When SMB activity occurs on the Files cluster through these shares, the Peer Partner Server (referred to as a Peer Agent) is notified via the File Activity Monitoring API from Files. The Peer Partner Server interacts with the same content via SMB then facilitates the flow of data to one or many remote and/or local file servers.

**In this lab you will deploy and configure the Peer Global File Service software to create an Active/Active file services solution with Nutanix Files.**

Lab Setup
+++++++++

Files
.....

This lab requires an existing Nutanix Files deployment on your assigned cluster. If you have not yet already completed the :ref:`files` lab, please complete the :ref:`deploying_files` section before proceeding.

Create a new **SMB** share on your Files cluster named *Initials*\ **-Peer**.

Peer VMs
........

In this exercise you will use Prism Central to stage 3 VMs which will later be used to install Peer software. The **Primary** cluster is the same assigned cluster you have been using for all other labs. Refer to :ref:`clusterassignments` to determine the Prism Central IP for your **Secondary** cluster.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 20 40
   :header-rows: 1

   * - **VM Name**
     - **Nutanix Cluster**
     - **Description**
   * - *Initials*\ -**PeerMgmt**
     - Primary
     - This server will host the Peer Management Center
   * - *Initials*\ -**PeerAgentA**
     - Primary
     - This server will manage the Nutanix Files cluster
   * - *Initials*\ -**PeerAgentB**
     - Secondary
     - This Windows File Server will be used as a target for replication

Once complete, your lab environment will resemble the diagram below:

.. figure:: images/setupdiagram.png

--------------------------------------------------------------------

On your **Primary Prism Central**, select :fa:`bars` **> Virtual Infrastructure > VMs**.

.. figure:: images/1.png

Click **Create VM**.

.. note::

  Selecting the **Secondary** network is important as it is configured as the Client network for the Files deployment. VMs on the **Primary** network (configured as the Files Storage network) are unable to access shares.

.. note::

  If you are comfortable working with **unattend.xml** files, you can edit the **<ComputerName>\*</ComputerName>** line to reflect the respective VM Name during VM creation. This will simplify identification of the Peer Agent VMs later in the lab.

Fill out the following fields:

- **Name** - *Initials*\ -PeerMgmt
- **Description** - (Optional) Description for your VM.
- **vCPU(s)** - 2
- **Number of Cores per vCPU** - 1
- **Memory** - 4 GiB

- Select **+ Add New Disk**
    - **Type** - DISK
    - **Operation** - Clone from Image Service
    - **Image** - Windows2012R2.qcow2
    - Select **Add**

- Select **Add New NIC**
    - **VLAN Name** - Secondary
    - Select **Add**
- Select **Custom Script**
- Select **Type or Paste Script**

.. literalinclude:: unattend.xml
   :caption: PeerMgmt and PeerAgentA Unattend.xml
   :language: xml

Click **Save** to create the VM.

Repeat the above steps to create a second VM named *Initials*\ **-PeerAgentA**.

**Power On** your *Initials*\ **-PeerMgmt** and *Initials*\ **-PeerAgentB** VMs.

--------------------------------------------------------

Log in to your **Secondary Prism Central** and create the following VM:

- **Name** - *Initials*\ -PeerAgentB
- **Description** - (Optional) Description for your VM.
- **vCPU(s)** - 2
- **Number of Cores per vCPU** - 1
- **Memory** - 4 GiB

- Select **+ Add New Disk**
    - **Type** - DISK
    - **Operation** - Clone from Image Service
    - **Image** - Windows2012R2.qcow2
    - Select **Add**

- Select **Add New NIC**
    - **VLAN Name** - Secondary
    - Select **Add**
- Select **Custom Script**
- Select **Type or Paste Script**

.. literalinclude:: unattendpeeragentB.xml
   :caption: PeerAgentB Unattend.xml
   :language: xml

Click **Save** and **Power on** the VM.

.. note::

  There is a slight difference in the Sysprep script for PeerAgentB where the VM is not automatically joined to the NTNXLAB.local domain. This is because each cluster has an independent domain controller and we require that all VMs in the lab authenticate against the same Active Directory environment.

Once *Initials*\ **-PeerAgentB** has powered on and completed its initial Sysprep process (~2 minutes), connect to the VM via RDP using the following credentials:

- **Username** - Administrator
- **Password** - nutanix/4u

Open **PowerShell** and execute the following command, replacing **10.XX.YY.40** with the IP address of your primary cluster's **AutoDC2** (Domain Controller) VM:

.. code-block:: Powershell
  :emphasize-lines: 1

  # Updates your network adapter to use your Primary cluster DC for DNS
  Set-DnsClientServerAddress -InterfaceAlias "Ethernet" -ServerAddress "10.XX.YY.40"

.. note::

  When copying and pasting via RDP, pasting directly into PowerShell is inconsistent. If this is an issue, first paste into Notepad within the VM, then copy and paste into PowerShell.

Run ``ipconfig /all`` and verify your **DNS Server** is set to the IP address of the **AutoDC2** VM on your primary cluster.

Execute the following to join the domain and reboot *Initials*\ **PeerAgentB**:

.. code-block:: Powershell
  :emphasize-lines: 1

  # Joins the NTNXLAB.local domain of your Primary cluster and reboots the VM
  $pass = convertto-securestring "nutanix/4u" -asplaintext -force
  $domaincred = new-object system.management.automation.pscredential "NTNXLAB\Administrator",$pass
  add-computer -credential $domaincred -domainname "NTNXLAB.local" -restart -force

Windows File Server
...................

The final step of staging the lab is configuring *Initials*\ **-PeerAgentB** as a Windows File Server. Peer is capable of leveraging its agent software to perform...

Connect to *Initials*\ **-PeerAgentB** via RDP using the following credentials:

- **Username** - NTNXLAB\\Administrator (**NOT** the local Administrator account)
- **Password** - nutanix/4u

Open **File Explorer** and create a new folder under ``C:\`` named **Data**.

Right-click **Data** and select **Properties**.

.. figure:: images/2.png

Under the **Sharing** tab, click **Share**.

.. figure:: images/3.png

Enter **Everyone** and click **Add**. Change the **Permission Level** to **Read/Write**.

.. figure:: images/4.png

Click **Share > Done > Close**.

Finally, you will populate your newly created Windows file share with sample data.

Within your *Initials*\ **-PeerAgentB** VM, download the **SampleData_Small.zip** file from http://10.42.8.50/peer/ and extract its contents in ``C:\Data\``. When complete, your Data directory should resemble the screenshot below:

.. figure:: images/5.png

Port Diagram
............

The following illustration shows necessary ports and communication flow for the joint Nutanix Files and Peer Global File Service environment. It is informational only, as the lab environment will only leverage a single Nutanix Files cluster.

.. figure:: images/portdiagram.png

.. note::

  For complete details on firewall requirements for Nutanix Files, Peer Agents, and Peer Management Center, see <...can we link to this somewhere?...>

Configuring Nutanix Files
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

Peer Global File Service requires both a File Server Admin account as well as RESI API access to orchestrate replication to or from Nutanix Files.

Log in to **Prism Element** (e.g. 10.XX.YY.37) on your **Primary** Nutanix cluster.

Navigate to **File Server** from the drop down navigation and select your *Initials*\ **-Files** cluster.

Click **Manage roles**.

.. figure:: images/6.png

Under **Add admins**, **NTNXLAB\\Administrator** should already be added as a **Filer Server Admin**. If not, click **+ New user** and add **NTNXLAB\\Administrator**.

.. figure:: images/7.png

.. note::

  In a production environment you would likely use an Active Directory service account for Peer.

Under **REST API access users**, click **+ Add new user**.

Fill out the following fields and click **Save**:

- **Username** - peer
- **Password** - nutanix/4u

.. figure:: images/8.png

Click **Close**.

Installing Peer Management Center
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In this exercise you'll walk through the installation of Peer Management Center (PMC). PMC serves as the centralized management component for the Peer Global File Service.

<... Any other context we want to throw in here about PMC - capability to manage X number of agents/sites, etc.?>

Connect to your *Initials*\ -**PeerMgmt** VM on your **Primary** cluster via RDP or VM console using the following credentials:

- **Username** - NTNXLAB\\Administrator
- **Password** - nutanix/4u

Within the VM, download **PMC_Installer_Win64.exe** AND **PeerGlobalFileService\*.lic** from http://10.42.8.50/peer/.

Run **PMC_Installer_Win64.exe** and proceed with the default selections **UNTIL** you reach **Peer Management Center Web Server Configuration**.

Note that for security purposes the PMC Web Service can be restricted to only allow access from the host on which the PMC is installed. **Leave the default configuration, as shown below**.

<...Would be helpful to explain what the Web Service is...>

.. figure:: images/9.png

Complete the installation using the default selections and click **Finish** to launch the PMC Client.

.. figure:: images/10.png

Once services have started, the PMC Client will open and prompt for a license file.

Click **Add/Update**, browse to the previously downloaded **PeerGlobalFileService\*.lic** file and click **Open**.

.. figure:: images/11.png

.. note::

  If accessing the *Initials*\ -**PeerMgmt** from the VM console, you may need to scroll the **Licensing** screen to the right in order to access the **Add/Update** button.

After the license is installed, click **OK** to close Preferences.

.. figure:: images/12.png

Installing the Peer Agent
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

The Peer Agent is one of the core components of Peer Global File Service. Each Agent directly interacts with an assigned file server to perform management, synchronization, and locking operations.

PeerAgentA
..........

Connect to your *Initials*\ -**PeerAgentA** VM on your **Primary** cluster via RDP or VM console using the following credentials:

- **Username** - NTNXLAB\\Administrator
- **Password** - nutanix/4u

Within the VM, download **P-Agent_Installer_win64.exe** from http://10.42.8.50/peer/.

Run **P-Agent_Installer_win64.exe** and proceed with the default selects **UNTIL** you reach **Peer Management Broker Configuration**.

Fill out the following fields and click **Next**:

- **Hostname** - *Initials*\ -PeerMgmt IP Address
- **Protocol** - TCP
- **Port** - *Leave default*

.. figure:: images/13.png

.. note::

  When the Agent will communicate with the PMC over a secure VPN or local connection it is recommended to set the protocol to **TCP**. Otherwise, the Agent will use TLS 1.2 to secure communication with the PMC.

Provide the following credentials for the **Agent Service Account**:

- Select **Enter Domain Admin Credentials**
- **Domain\\UserName** - NTNXLAB\\Administrator
- **Password** - nutanix/4u
- **Re-enter Password** - nutanix/4u

.. figure:: images/14.png

The Peer Agent service account must be a domain user with local administrator rights on both the Agent VM as well as the Nutanix Files cluster that it will manage.

Click **Next > Next > Finish** to complete the installation of the Peer Agent software.

Return to the **PMC Client** on your *Initials*\ -**PeerMgmt** VM and verify the hostname of your *Initials*\ -**PeerAgentA** VM appears as **Connected** under **Agent Detail Summary**.

.. figure:: images/15.png

.. note::

  If it is not listed, check local firewall policies on the PMC server.  The PMC requires that inbound port 61617 be open for SSL/TLS communication and the inbound port 61616 be open for non-SSL/TLS communication.

PeerAgentB
..........

Connect to your *Initials*\ -**PeerAgentB** VM on your **Secondary** cluster via RDP or VM console using the following credentials:

- **Username** - NTNXLAB\\Administrator
- **Password** - nutanix/4u

Repeat the steps in `PeerAgentA`_ to install the Peer Agent software on *Initials*\ -**PeerAgentB**.

Once you have completed Agent installation, both Agent VMs should appear as **Connected** in the **PMC Client**.

.. figure:: images/16.png

Creating a New Job
++++++++++++++++++

Peer Global File Service utilizes a job-based configuration engine. Several different job types are available to help tackle different file management challenges. A job represents a combination of:

- Peer Agents.
-	The file servers that are being monitored by those Agents.
-	A specific share/volume/folder of data on each file server.
-	Various settings tied to replication, synchronization and/or locking.

When creating a new job, you will be prompted by a dialog outlining the different job types with graphics and text outlining why you would use each type. For this lab, we will focus on **File Collaboration**.

In the **PMC Client**, click **File > New Job**.

Select **File Collaboration** and click **Create**.

.. figure:: images/17.png

Provide a name for the job and click **OK**.

.. figure:: images/18.png

Files and PeerAgentA
....................

Click **Add** to begin pairing a Peer Agent with your Nutanix Files cluster.

.. figure:: images/19.png

Select **Nutanix Files** and click **Next**.

.. figure:: images/20.png

Select the VM hostname that corresponds to your *Initials*\ **-PeerAgentA** VM and click **Next**. This Agent will manage the Files cluster.

.. figure:: images/21.png

On the **Storage Information** page, fill out the following fields:

- **Nutanix Files Cluster Name** - *Initials*\ -Files

  *The NETBIOS name of the Files cluster that will be paired with the Agent selected in the previous step.*

- **Username** - peer

  *This is the Files API account username configured earlier in the lab.*

- **Password** - nutanix/4u

  *The password associated with the Files API account.*

- **Peer Agent IP** - *Initials*\ -PeerAgentA IP Address

  *The IP address of the Agent server that will receive real-time notifications from the Files File Activity Monitoring API.*

Click **Validate** to confirm Files can be accessed via API using the provided credentials.

.. figure:: images/22.png

.. note::

  Once you enter these credentials, they will be reusable when creating new jobs that use this particular Agent.  When you create your next job, select **Existing Credentials** on this page to display a list of previously configured credentials.

Click **Next**.

Click **Browse** to select the share you wish to replicate. You can also navigate to a subfolder below a share.

Select your *Initials*\ **-Peer** share and click **OK**.

.. figure:: images/23.png

.. note::

  While Nutanix Files 3.2 supports nested shares, they are not currently supported for replication with Peer Global File Service. Support for this feature is being targeted for Files 3.5 timeframe.

.. note::

  You can only select a single share or folder. You will need to create an additional job for each additional share you wish to replicate.

Click **Finish**. You have now completed pairing the Peer Agent to Nutanix Files.

.. figure:: images/24.png

PeerAgentB
..........

To simplify the lab exercise, the Peer Agent running on your **Secondary** cluster will also function as a standard Windows File Server. While Peer can be used to replicate shares between Nutanix Files clusters, one of its key advantages is the ability to work with mixed NAS platforms. This can help drive adoption of Nutanix Files when only a single site has been refreshed with Nutanix Files, but replication is still required to support collaboration or disaster recovery.

Repeat the steps in `Files and PeerAgentA`_ to add *Initials*\ **-PeerAgentB** to the job, making the following changes:

- **Storage Platform** - Windows File Server
- **Management Agent** - *Initials*\ **-PeerAgentB** Hostname
- **Path** - C:\\Data

.. figure:: images/25.png

Click **Next**.

Completing Job Configuration
............................

Peer offers robust functionality for handling the synchronization of NTFS permissions between shares:

- **Enable synchronizing NTFS security descriptors in real-time**

  *Select this checkbox if you want changes to file and folder permissions to be replicated to the remote file servers as they occur.*

- **Enable synchronizing NTFS security descriptors with master host during initial scan**

  *Select this if you want the initial scan to look for and replicate any permissions that are not in sync across file servers.  This requires selecting a master host to help resolve situations where the engine cannot pick a winner in a permission discrepancy.*

- **Synchronize Security Description Options**

  *(Optional) Select the NTFS permission types you would like to replicate*

  - **Owner**

    *The NTFS Creator-Owner who owns the object (which is, by default, whomever created it).*


  - **DACL**

    *A Discretionary Access Control List identifies the users and groups that are assigned or denied access permissions on a file or folder.*

  - **SACL**

    *A System Access Control List enables administrators to log attempts to access a secured file or folder. It is used for auditing.*

- **File Metadata Conflict Resolution**

  *If there is a permission discrepancy between two or more sites, the permissions set on the file server tied to the Master Host will override those on the other file servers.*

For the purposes of this lab exercise, leave the default configuration and click **Next**.

.. figure:: images/26.png

Under **Application Support**, select **Microsoft Office**.

The Peer synchronization and locking engine is automatically optimized to best support any of the selected applications.

.. figure:: images/27.png

Click **Next > Finish** to complete the job setup.

Starting a Job
++++++++++++++

*Show up on time, try to make a good impression*

Once a job has been created, it must be started to initiate synchronization and file locking.

In the **PMC Client**, under **Jobs**, right-click your newly created job and select **Start**.

.. figure:: images/28.png

When the job starts:

- Connectivity to all Agents and Files clusters (or other NAS devices) is checked.
- The real-time monitoring engine is initialized.
- A background scan is kicked off to ensure all file servers are in sync with another.

Double-click the job in the **Job** pane to view its runtime information and statistics.

.. note::

  Click **Auto-Update** to have the console regularly refresh as files begin replicating.

.. figure:: images/29.png

Testing the Share
+++++++++++++++++

.. note::

  This exercise requires the :ref:`windows_tools_vm`.

The easiest way to verify synchronization is functioning properly is to open 2 different File Explorer windows to the respective Nutanix Files and Windows File Server paths.

.. note::

  Do **NOT** test using an Agent server VM. Peer automatically filters all activity from these servers to reduce overhead on the Nutanix Files cluster.

Connect to your *Initials*\ **-Windows-ToolsVM** via RDP using the following credentials:

- **Username** - Administrator
- **Password** - nutanix/4u

Open File Explorer and browse to your Nutanix Files share, e.g. ``\\Initials-Files\Initials-Peer``. Drag this window to the left side of the desktop.

Note that the sample data seeded into the Windows File Server during lab setup has already been replicated to Nutanix Files.

.. note::

  You can also verify the replicated files in **Prism > File Server**.

Open a second File Explorer and browse to your Windows File Server share, e.g. ``\\Initials-PeerAgentB-IP\Data``. Drag this window to the right side of the desktop.

.. figure:: images/30.png

In the File Explorer on the left, create a copy of one of the sample data directories by copying and pasting within the root of the share (shown below).

.. figure:: images/31.png

.. figure:: images/32.png

The changes that are performed on the Nutanix Files share will be sent to its paired Agent, the Agent will then facilitate the replication of these files and folders to the other server (and vice versa).

.. figure:: images/33.png

**Congratulations!** You have successfully deployed an Active/Active file share replicated across 2 sites. Using Peer, this same approach can be leveraged to support file collaboration across sites, migrations from legacy solutions to Nutanix Files, or disaster recovery for use cases such as VDI, where user data and profiles need to be accessible from multiple sites for business continuity.

Takeaways
+++++++++

- Peer Global File Service is the only solution which can provide active/active replication for Nutanix Files clusters.

- Peer also supports multiple legacy NAS platforms, allowing for replication within mixed environments or easing migration to Nutanix Files.

- Peer can directly manage Microsoft Distributed File Services (DFS) namespaces, allowing multiple file servers to be presented through a single namespace. This is a key component for supporting true active/active DR solutions for file sharing.
