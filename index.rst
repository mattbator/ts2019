Nutanix Global Tech Summit 2019 Redux
-------------------------------------

Nutanix Global Tech Summit 2019 has come to a close. Across 3 worldwide events, nearly 1,300 attendees (including 250 partners) completed over 5,000 labs!

Didn't get a chance to finish a lab you were interested in? You're in luck! Nearly all of the labs offered during GTS2019 will continue to be available right here.

See :ref:`clusterinfo` for additional steps on how the reserve/stage a cluster to complete additional labs.

.. note::

   The Buckets lab is unavailable due to its dependence on a dedicated environment running pre-GA code. As the Nutanix Cloud Native lab required Buckets for S3 storage, it is also unavailable. Updated versions of these labs will be made available following Buckets GA.
